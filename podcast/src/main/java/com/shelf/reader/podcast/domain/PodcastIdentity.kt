 * Episode identity rules.

 * - Feed URL is the subscription identity and is normalized before storage.
 * - RSS/Atom GUID is preferred as episode identity (scoped by feed so two feeds
 *   with the same GUID cannot collide).
 * - If the GUID is blank, or duplicated inside the same feed, fall back to
 *   normalized feed URL + enclosure URL.
 * - Episode title is NEVER used as identity.
